Toggle wc mode With no argument, this command toggles the
mode.  Non-null prefix argument turns on the mode.  Null prefix
argument turns off the mode.

When Wc mode is enabled on a buffer, it counts the current words
in the buffer and keeps track of a differential of added or
subtracted words.

A goal of number of words added/subtracted can be set while using
this mode. Upon completion of the goal, the modeline text will
highlight indicating that the goal has been reached.

Commands:
\\{wc-goal-mode-map}

Entry to this mode calls the value of `wc-goal-mode-hook' if that
value is non-nil.
